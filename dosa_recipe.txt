Immediately, starting from the center, begin forming a circular shape with the batter using the flat-bottomed dish.
Brush on ghee (or regular butter) to frying dosa.
Place filling near the center of the dosa.
Lightly lift the edges of the dosa.
Begin rolling from the edge of the dosa as you would a wrap.
Remove dosa from hot top or skillet.
Masala Dosa is typically served with coconut, cilantro and tomato chutney as well as sambar (vegetable lentil stew)
